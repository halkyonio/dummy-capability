# Instructions to create a new plugin

The process to create a new [`plugin`](https://github.com/halkyonio/operator-framework/tree/master/plugins) able to manage a new capability for the `halkyon` operator is pretty straightforward 
and consists in a few steps :

- Git clone the project `https://github.com/halkyonio/plugin-example-capability` and rename it 
- Rename the `module name` as defined within the `go.mod` file to use your `package name`
- Find and replace the `example` word with the name of your `plugin` or `resource` for the following files/folders:
  - Folder : `cmd/example-capability`
  - File   :`pkg/plugin/capability/example.go`
  - Resource : `type example struct`
- Rename the import `halkyon.io/example-capability/...` statement to use your capability path
- Build and deploy it under the local `plugins` folder of the `halkyon` operator to test it

The plugin allows you to encapsulate 3rd party go libraries, your dependent kubernetes resources
and to generate a secret by example containing the parameters provided by the Capability.

## For the coder only

As the plugin will handle additional types not currently managed by the `Halkyon` Operator, then it is needed that you review and extend the `go.mod`
file to add your library handling your `Custom Resource Type`

Next you must create the `Custom Resource` owning the `dependent` resources using the function `Build` declared within the file 
[example](pkg/plugin/capability/example.go)
```go
func (res example) Build(empty bool) (runtime.Object, error) {
	pod := &v1.Pod{}
    ...
    return pod, nil
}
```
**Note**: This function will be called by the `Halkyon` operator when it will call the rpc server

The dependent resources are declared within the body of the function `GetDependentResourcesWith` of the [file](pkg/plugin/capability/resource.go)
This function returns an array of `DependentResource` containing your owner resources and the dependents (e.g : secret, configmap, ...)
```go
func (p *PluginResource) GetDependentResourcesWith(owner v1beta1.HalkyonResource) []framework.DependentResource {
	p.logger.Info("calling GetDependentResourcesWith")
	ownerResource := NewOwnerResource(owner)
	return []framework.DependentResource{
		ownerResource,
		plugin.NewSecret(ownerResource),
	}
}
```

## Build the plugin

To build the plugin, execute the following command within a terminal
```bash
go build -o example-plugin ./cmd/example-capability/plugin.go
```
Next, copy/paste the `example-capability` binary file generated by the build under the `plugins` folder of the `halkyon` operator project cloned locally
and launch the Operator. The plugin will be automatically loaded.
```bash

```

## Debug

- If you plan to debug the `rpc` plugin, simply add the following compilation parameters to the `go build` command
  ```bash
  go build -gcflags="all=-N -l" -o example-plugin ./cmd/example-capability/plugin.go
  ```

- Next, start the Operator in Debug mode. During the launch of the operator, the plugin will be loaded and the RPC server started.
- Use the `Attach to Process` debug option of your IDE to start within this project a debugger.
- Add a breakpoint within the file that you would like to watch and deploy a capability
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deploy/example-capability.yml
  ```
- Enjoy !  

## Release 

To release your plugin, configure your github project to use the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file responsible to perform
the `go releases` using the configuration of the file `.goreleaser.yml`. 
You can find more information about the goreleaser action [here](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-action) and [`Halkyon plugin release`](https://github.com/halkyonio/operator-framework/tree/master/plugins#using-plugins-in-halkyon).
